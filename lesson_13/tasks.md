# Task 1 part 1
"""
Each line of cities_and_times.txt contains the name of the city, followed by 
the weekday (1-7) and the time in the form hh:mm. Read in the file and 
create new file new.txt where yeah weekday is written as actual day from

week_days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday',
			 'Saturday', 'Sunday']

Try to solve this problem by reading cities_and_times.txt character by 
character (read(1)) and write based on what you currently see.
